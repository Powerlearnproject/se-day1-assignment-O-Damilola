#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods,
and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
    
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software
applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Milestones include:
a) The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C etc.)

1883: The Journey starts from here

In the early days, Charles Babbage had made the device, but he was confused about how to give instructions to the machine, 
and then Ada Lovelace wrote the instructions for the analytical engine.
The device was made by Charles Babbage and the code was written by Ada Lovelace for computing Bernoulli’s number.
First time in history that the capability of computer devices was judged.

1949: Assembly Language
It is a type of low-level language.
It mainly consists of instructions (kind of symbols) that only machines could understand.
In today’s time also assembly language is used in real-time programs such as simulation flight navigation systems and medical equipment eg – Fly-by-wire (FBW) systems.
It is also used to create computer viruses.

1952: Autocode
Developed by Alick Glennie.
The first compiled computer programming language.
COBOL and FORTRAN are the languages referred to as Autocode.

1957: FORTRAN
Developers are John Backus and IBM.
It was designed for numeric computation and scientific computing.
Software for NASA probes voyager-1 (space probe) and voyager-2 (space probe) was originally written in FORTRAN 5.

1958: ALGOL
ALGOL stands for ALGOrithmic Language.
The initial phase of the most popular programming languages of C, C++, and JAVA.
It was also the first language implementing the nested function and has a simple syntax than FORTRAN.
The first programming language to have a code block like “begin” that indicates that your program has started and “end” means you have ended your code.

1959: COBOL
It stands for COmmon Business-Oriented Language.
In 1997, 80% of the world’s business ran on Cobol.
The US internal revenue service scrambled its path to COBOL-based IMF (individual master file) in order to pay the tens of millions of 
payments mandated by the     coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security.

1964: BASIC
It stands for beginners All-purpose symbolic instruction code.
In 1991 Microsoft released Visual Basic, an updated version of Basic
The first microcomputer version of Basic was co-written by Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and Monte Davidoff for their newly-formed company, Microsoft.

1972: C
It is a general-purpose, procedural programming language and the most popular programming language till now.
All the code that was previously written in assembly language gets replaced by the C language like operating system, kernel, and many other applications.
It can be used in implementing an operating system, embedded system, and also on the website using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
C is the mother of almost all higher-level programming languages like C#, D, Go, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, Perl, PHP, Python, and Unix’s C shell.

        
b) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

In the 1960s, software development faced significant challenges due to increasing software complexity and the need for systematic engineering practices.
To address these issues, a series of conferences were held, leading to the following key developments:

1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering: Coined the term "software engineering" and established a foundation for the discipline.
1969 Conference on Data Structures in Programming Languages: Emphasized the importance of modularity, abstract data types, and structured programming.
Establishment of Degree Programs: Universities began offering Master's and Ph.D. programs in software engineering.
Development of Software Engineering Methodologies: Techniques such as the Waterfall model and Agile methods emerged to guide software development processes.
Formation of Professional Societies: IEEE Computer Society established the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering in 1975.
These initiatives fostered a shift from ad-hoc software development to a more structured and engineering-based approach,
laying the foundation for the modern discipline of software engineering.
        

c) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s

In the 1970s, structured programming emerged as a paradigm shift in software development. It emphasized:

Modularity: Breaking programs into smaller, well-defined modules that could be independently tested and maintained.
Control Flow: Using structured control statements (e.g., if-else, while loops) to improve code readability and maintainability.
Data Abstraction: Separating data structures from the code that operates on them, promoting data encapsulation and reducing coupling.
Top-Down Design: Decomposing programs into hierarchical levels of abstraction, starting with high-level concepts and gradually refining them.

Structured programming introduced concepts like structured flowcharts and pseudocode to represent program logic clearly.
It allowed for more organized, efficient, and maintainable code.
This had a profound impact on software engineering practices, leading to improved software quality, reliability, and maintainability.
        
d) The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

In the 2000s, agile methodologies gained widespread adoption as a response to the limitations of traditional software development approaches.
Key factors contributing to their rise include:

Increased software complexity: Software systems became increasingly complex, requiring more iterative and adaptable development processes.

Need for faster delivery: Businesses demanded faster time-to-market for new software products, leading to a shift towards incremental development.

Emergence of lean manufacturing principles: Agile methodologies borrow principles from lean manufacturing,
such as continuous improvement and waste reduction.

Dissatisfaction with traditional methodologies: Waterfall and other traditional approaches proved insufficient for modern
software development due to their inflexibility and lack of adaptability.

Adoption by tech giants: Technology companies like Google and Amazon embraced agile practices, popularizing them within the industry.
Agile methodologies became known for their principles of flexibility, iterative development, and customer involvement,
offering significant benefits in terms of project efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.
